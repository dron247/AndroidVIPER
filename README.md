# AndroidVIPER
VIPER architecture example for Android applications. This is not a template and a boilerplate, this repo made as an illustration of architecture pattern. It's clean and if you want to start your applicattion with it, then you should add all needed dependencies and other setup yourself. Again, this repo just an illustration of how VIPER components works with each other.
